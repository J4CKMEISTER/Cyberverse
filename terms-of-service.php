                    Ellation, LLC. ("Ellation", "we" or "us") provides our website accessible at <a href="home.php" target="_blank">hyperhasagi.com</a> (the "Site") through which users can participate in an online community dedicated to enjoying anime, premium animation, sci-fi, fantasy and media in all forms (the "Services"). Please read the following important terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") carefully. These Terms of Use and all policies referenced in this document or elsewhere on the Site that are incorporated herein by reference govern your access to and use of the Site and Services. These Terms of Use are a legal agreement between you and Ellation and apply to you whether you are a Hyper Hasagi Member (defined below) or a visitor just browsing the Site (collectively, "Hyper Hasagi Users"). These Terms of Use limit Ellation's liability and obligations to you, grant us certain rights and allow us to change, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Site and Services.

                    YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY USING THE SITE, SERVICES OR YOUR Hyper Hasagi ACCOUNT OR BY POSTING ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES. IF YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE ON BEHALF OF A BUSINESS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT BUSINESS TO THESE TERMS OF USE AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS WILL BE TREATED AS THE AGREEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. IN THAT EVENT, "YOU" AND "YOUR" WILL REFER AND APPLY TO THAT BUSINESS.

                    <br><br><strong>1. Eligibility and Registration.</strong><br>
                    In order to access certain features of the Site and Services, and to post any content on the Site or via the Services, you will have to create a Hyper Hasagi account and become a "Hyper Hasagi Member". To become a Hyper Hasagi Member you must be at least 16 years of age. When you register with Ellation and set up your Hyper Hasagi account, you must provide Ellation with accurate and complete information. You agree to promptly update your Hyper Hasagi account information with any new information. You authorize Ellation, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary or appropriate to verify your Hyper Hasagi account information. Our Privacy Policy contains information about our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from Hyper Hasagi Users.

                    <br>You will not use false identities or impersonate any other person or use a username or password that you are not authorized to use. Ellation reserves the right to require you to change your username for any reason and may do so at anytime.

                    <br>You are responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your username, password and corresponding Hyper Hasagi account information. You agree not to disclose your password to anyone. You agree that you are entirely and solely responsible for any and all activities or actions that occur under your Hyper Hasagi account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You agree to immediately notify Ellation of any unauthorized use of your username, password or Hyper Hasagi account.

                    <br><br><strong>2. Access to Certain Content: Fees and Billing.</strong><br>
                    Hyper Hasagi Members may be able to access and/or purchase Hyper Hasagi Content (as defined below) through the Site or Services in a few different ways including: (i) Hyper Hasagi Members can pay a monthly membership fee to view certain Hyper Hasagi Content for the applicable time period ("Membership Fee"); or (ii) Hyper Hasagi Members may initially sign-up for a free trial and then convert such free trial to a membership to view Hyper Hasagi Content via a Membership Fee. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO PRORATED REFUNDS OF ANY FEES UPON ANY TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION. Fees are refundable in Ellation's sole discretion. You agree to immediately pay any amounts accrued, but remaining unpaid, as of termination (if any). You hereby authorize Ellation to collect fees by charging the credit card you provide to us as part of your Hyper Hasagi account information, either directly or indirectly via a third party online payment service, such as PayPal ("Payment Method").

                    <br>Your access to Hyper Hasagi Content may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for seven (7) days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and certain former members only. Ellation reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.

                    <br>We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly Membership Fee at the end of the free trial period of your membership unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your membership, including the monthly Membership Fee, visit the Site and click on the "Your Account" link available at the top of the pages of the Site. You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.

                    <br>By starting your Hyper Hasagi membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly Membership Fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including gift card redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a channel or bundle, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which will be billed monthly in one or more charges.

                    <br>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect in accordance with the time frame outlined in the email notice to you.

                    <br>The Membership Fee for the Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Hyper Hasagi membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your membership. As used in these Terms of Use, "bill" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method.

                    <br>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link, available at the top of the pages of the Site. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

                    <br>You may cancel your Hyper Hasagi membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Site and/or Services through the end of your monthly billing period. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.
